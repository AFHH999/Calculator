# Python Calculator with GUI

## Description
This project is a graphical calculator built using Python and PySide6. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic mathematical operations and includes support for both button clicks and keyboard input.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Support for parentheses to control operation order
- Special functions: square root, pi constant
- Positive/negative number toggle
- Clear and backspace functionality
- Error handling for invalid expressions
- Keyboard input support for quick calculations

## Technical Details
- Built with Python 3.x
- GUI implemented using PySide6
- Mathematical operations powered by SymPy library for accurate calculations

## How to Use
1. Run the script to launch the calculator interface.
2. Input numbers and operations using either the on-screen buttons or your keyboard.
3. Press '=' or Enter to calculate the result.
4. Use 'C' or Escape to clear the input field.
5. Use 'âŒ«' or Backspace to delete the last character.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install required libraries:
3. Run the script:

## Future Improvements
- Add more advanced mathematical functions
- Implement memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)
- Create a history log of calculations
- Add unit conversion capabilities
